# Project State

_Last updated: 2026-10-10_

## Current phase

**Phase 0 — Foundation & alignment (finishing).**
- Core direction decided: portfolio-level architecture, OpenAI, web-enriched knowledge base, brand-fit and plant/platform feasibility gates, per-market scoring, future-need projection, continuous re-prioritization, $100 model budget.
- No application code yet.
- **Next: architecture discussion with the team (Q-014). Scaffolding comes later, only when Atahan says so.**

## Team & logistics (fill in — Q-007, Q-008)

| Item | Value |
|---|---|
| Team members & roles | _TODO_ |
| Who plays the PM in the demo | _TODO_ |
| Submission deadline | _TODO_ |
| Demo format / length | _TODO_ |
| Judging criteria (beyond the brief) | _TODO_ |

## Proposed minimal demo path (for the team to confirm — not decided)

One thin slice end-to-end before anything else (AGENTS rule 18). It covers BMW's minimum of one derivative in one market (`challenge-brief.md`).
- **Scope:** 5 Series (D-005).
  - **G60 × US:** ~3.6k verbatims + detailed study + sales. Best-evidenced.
  - **G68 × CN:** study + sales, no verbatims, so web evidence and the market conflict carry it (D-011).
  - G60 × EU as an optional third target (~110 verbatims + study).
- **Flow:**
  1. Classify the G60 verbatims.
  2. Group them into findings with sources.
  3. Derive ~10–15 requirements with targets US/CN.
  4. Run fit checks.
  5. Score and explain.
  6. PM approves, rejects or challenges a few.
  7. Show the audit trail.
  8. Run wave 2 (Q-012) and show priority changes + change proposals.
- F70/G70 stay supported by the data model and run later through the same pipeline.

## Done

- Challenge analyzed; all BMW data profiled and re-verified (`documents/data-inventory.md`).
- Foundation, `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md` created.
- BMW mentor input recorded (D-011 markets differ, D-012 future needs, D-013 continuous re-prioritization). BMW support recommended the annual report → `documents/bmw-annual-report-2025.md`.
- Model tiering (D-010); budget re-baselined (D-014).
- Q-001/002/003 answered by Atahan → D-005 (portfolio-level, 5 Series deepest), D-006 (OpenAI), D-007 (web knowledge base), D-008 (brand fit gate), D-009 (plant/platform feasibility).
- Conceptual architecture, requirement model and knowledge-base design drafted. The tech stack is open (Q-014).
- Web research seeds written and fact-checked:
  - `portfolio-reference.md`: platforms, 14 vehicle plants + 3 CKD sites, BMW sales 2024–H1 2026, primary-sourced from the annual report where possible.
  - `competitor-landscape.md`: competitors, trends, expectations, brand-fit guardrails.
- Foundation review (2026-10-10) fixed, except the confidentiality items, which Atahan dropped.

## In progress

- Nothing.

## Next up (suggested order)

0. Fill in Team & logistics.
1. Ask BMW mentors: Q-005 (sources), Q-006 (scales + sample sizes), Q-010 (feasibility framing), Q-015 (sales volumes real?), Q-016 (ADAS scope).
2. **Architecture discussion (Q-014)**: orchestration, retrieval/RAG, vector store, graph, storage, backend/frontend, data-model size. The team decides, then logs decisions.
3. Confirm or replace the proposed minimal demo path above.
4. *(Later, only on Atahan's go)* Scaffold the repo. The budget-guarded LLM wrapper + usage logging come first, before any paid call. Then the pilot (D-014).
5. Reference layer: load brands, segments, platforms, plants, production and sales from the seed docs (with source IDs) into the store chosen in Q-014.
6. Ingest BMW data for the demo slice first, then all derivatives, organized into ingest waves (Q-012).
7. Signal extraction, market-segmented → findings with sources (method per Q-014).
8. Research agents (competitor, market, review, trend, market profile) → web evidence.
9. Requirement derivation + future-need projection → fit checks → per-market scoring → prioritization runs + change proposals.
10. PM review UI + audit trail + export.
11. Demo script (multi-wave, shows re-prioritization over time).

## Budget (OpenAI, $100 total — plan in D-014)

| Item | Value |
|---|---|
| Spent to date | **$0.00** (no app LLM calls yet) |
| Planned build spend | ≈ $60 (≈ $48 + 25% contingency) |
| Warn / block non-demo / app hard stop | $45 / $70 / $90 |
| Demo-day reserve | $20 ($70 → $90) |
| OpenAI project hard limit | $95 (to set by Atahan, + $45 alert) |

Update this table after every paid run. Once the app exists, the source of truth is the wrapper's usage log.

## Risks / watch-outs

- Local anaconda Python 3.9 has a broken pandas/numpy → use `uv venv --python 3.12`.
- Option lists are German-market only — the US/CN equipment baseline is an assumption.
- Plant capacity/flexibility is rarely public → feasibility checks need explicit assumptions (Q-011).
- BMW says engineering is out of scope → keep feasibility framed as a filter (Q-010).
- BMW data must never be committed or sent anywhere except OpenAI (AGENTS rule 1).
- Public sales are only in model-series pairs, with no regional per-model figures. Model-level market volume relies on BMW's `sales_volumes.xlsx`, which looks stylized and conflicts with public China data (Q-015).
- Scoring as drafted penalizes CN (no verbatims) and G70 EU (~19 verbatims) — see Q-004.
- Feedback data has no dates → the 2-year process must be demoed as simulated ingest waves (Q-012).
- `gpt-6-luna` structured-output quality is untested → pilot first (D-014); fallback `gpt-5-mini`.
- China-built i5 (G68 BEV) reportedly ended Jul 2026 (insider rumour, unconfirmed by BMW as of 2026-10-10) — affects 5 Series China powertrain assumptions.
- X5/7 Series successors: BMW calls them NK models, trade press says the platform is CLAR-derived (`bmw-annual-report-2025.md` §4). This matters for the G70 successor.
